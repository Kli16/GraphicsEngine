# Graphics Final Project
Kevin Li
Period 10

<h2> Two new primitive shapes were added: </h2>
1. pyramid <br>
2. cone

<h2> the mdl takes two new commands: </h2> <br>
<code> <b> pyramid x y z width height depth </b> </code> <br>
where (x, y, z) is the bottom left corner of the pyramid, and the height is the vertical height.

<code> <b> cone x y z r h </b> </code> <br>
where (x, y, z) is the center of the base of the cone, the radius is the base radius, and the height is the vertical height.
